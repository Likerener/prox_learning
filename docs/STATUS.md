# Project status — 2026-05-02 (Day 1 of 26)

This document is the authoritative snapshot of where the PLA project stands.
**Update it at the end of every working day** (and after any non-trivial
push). It is intentionally thorough — for an academic paper we cannot afford
ambiguity about what is built versus claimed.

Companion docs (read together):
- [TIMELINE.md](TIMELINE.md) — the 26-day plan
- [IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md](IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md) — what got built, when, why
- [SANITY_CHECKS.md](SANITY_CHECKS.md) — every check command + verbatim output
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — full system architecture and shapes
- [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) — every non-obvious choice
- [FILE_INVENTORY.md](FILE_INVENTORY.md) — file-by-file what's in the repo

## TL;DR

Day 1 work: **the entire repository scaffold and codebase has been
implemented from the technical summary and is verified to parse, import,
and produce non-zero gradients through every code path.** The model layer,
data pipeline, training loop, evaluation harness, ablation orchestration,
sanity checks, and per-folder scientific READMEs are all in place. The
remaining 25 days are about *running* the pipeline (collecting data,
training, evaluating) — not *writing* it.

## What is *not* yet done

These items are explicitly out of scope for Day 1 and tracked here so they
don't get forgotten:

| Item                                                  | When      | Why deferred |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Real Molmo2-4B weights pulled from HF                 | Day 4     | 9 GB download; not needed for sanity checks |
| MJCF skin built from current URDF                     | Day 2     | Depends on Blender skin redesign (Day 1 PM)  |
| 1000-trajectory near-contact dataset collected        | Day 3-4   | Requires MJCF + MolmoSpaces wired up         |
| `stats.json` from real data                           | Day 4     | Depends on dataset                           |
| Any real training run                                  | Day 4-7   | Depends on dataset + stats                   |
| 100-episode evaluation on each task                    | Day 14    | Depends on trained checkpoints                |
| Paper figures (system overview, ToF heatmap, etc.)    | Day 12-13 | Depends on real dataset + results            |
| `pla/viz/heatmap.py` finishing touches (CLI)          | Day 12    | Stub exists; needs --tof-h5 + --importance-json paths fleshed out |
| `pla/checks/depth_reconstruction.py` integration       | Day 2     | Code exists but assumes a built MJCF          |
| `pla/checks/replay_mjcf.py` integration                | Day 2     | Same — needs MJCF + a recorded trajectory     |

## Day-by-day plan vs. status

The plan in [TIMELINE.md](TIMELINE.md) covers Days 1-26. Status checkboxes
below get ticked as we cross the calendar.

### Week 1 (May 2-8): Infrastructure + Data + First Training

- [x] **Day 1 (May 2):** Repository scaffold, all module code, READMEs, sanity checks.
  Failure-case analysis on existing MolmoBot-Pi0 eval is *separate* — not a
  code task.
- [ ] **Day 2 (May 3):** Patch FR3 MJCF with new sensor positions; run
  `pla.checks.depth_reconstruction` and `pla.checks.replay_mjcf` against the
  built MJCF. Schema-validate the existing collection on disk.
- [ ] **Day 3 (May 4):** Launch `bash scripts/collect_data.sh near_contact 1000`
  in tmux. Implement VLM-only ACT (already done as a config flag).
  ProximityEncoder + fusion (already done).
- [ ] **Day 4 (May 5):** Check overnight collection. Run prop-only MLP
  baseline. Verify VLM-only ACT loss curves are converging. Dummy forward
  pass already verified (no work needed Day 4 here).
- [ ] **Day 5 (May 6):** VLM-only ACT eval — 50 episodes near-contact + standard PnP.
- [ ] **Day 6 (May 7):** Verify proximity encoder grad-norm > 1e-8 on the
  *real* training run. The CLI sanity check (`pla.checks.grad_norm`) already
  validates this on synthetic data.
- [ ] **Day 7 (May 8):** First PLA numbers. Eval PLA checkpoint vs VLM-only ACT.

### Week 2 (May 9-15): Full Evaluation + Ablations

- [ ] **Day 8-9:** Launch all ablations overnight. Full evaluation: 100 episodes per condition.
- [ ] **Day 10-11:** Collect ablation numbers + sensor-importance heatmap.
- [ ] **Day 12:** Figures.
- [ ] **Day 13-14:** Lock results.

### Week 3 (May 16-22): Write the paper

- [ ] **Day 15-21:** Sections 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 2 → 1 → Abstract.

### Week 4 (May 23-28): Revise, Format, Submit

- [ ] **Day 22-27:** Alessandro feedback, format pass, supplementary, **submit**.

## Risk register (live)

changes.**

## Open follow-ups (TODO)

In rough priority order. Nothing here is blocking Day 2 work.

1. **Wire `MolmoSpaces` real env** into `pla.eval.run_eval._make_env`. Right
   now we use lazy import; once the submodule is built we should validate
   the actual class name (`FrankaPickandPlaceEnv` is a guess from
   `pla/eval/tasks.py`).
2. **Real Molmo2 vision-token extraction.** `pla/models/vlm_backbone.py:
   _extract_vision_tokens` follows the documented HF call but needs to be
   verified against the live MolmoBot inference wrapper (see comment block
   in that file for the exact grep).
3. **Wandb pinning.** `train.py` uses `wandb.init` if available; pin a
   wandb version in `pyproject.toml` once the W&B project is live.
4. **`pla/viz/heatmap.py` CLI.** Currently exposes `tof_sequence` and
   `sensor_importance_heatmap` as functions; the README references CLI
   flags that are not yet wired to argparse. Expand on Day 12 figure work.
5. **Failure-analysis env-key mapping.** `pla.eval.failure_analysis.RULES`
   uses key names (`collided_with_obstacle`, `grasp_failed`, etc.) that we
   *expect* MolmoSpaces to emit. Confirm Day 5 against the actual env.
6. **Tests directory.** No `pytest` test files yet; the sanity-check
   scripts cover the same ground but a `tests/` dir would make CI cleaner.
   Defer until after submission.
